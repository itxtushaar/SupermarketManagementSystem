- **Tkinter**: GUI toolkit for creating the applicationâ€™s interface.
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video from the webcam.
- **Pygame**: For playing the scanner sound.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For image processing.
- **PyZbar**: For barcode decoding.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating statistical plots.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pymysql**: For MySQL database connectivity.
- **MySQL**: Database management system.
